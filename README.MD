# Introduction

This is a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes from people about computers, coding, and technology.

# Goal

a quick reference for Express.js HTTP requests

# how to use it

In this project, there is a **quotes** array with some pre-populated quotes people said about technology. Each quote in the array has a `person` and `quote` property.
Simple `app.get()` and `app.post()` HTTP routing requests examples that you can:

- get and present a random quote from the array in HTML
- get and present all of the quotes from the array in HTML
- get quote/s by one person and display them on an HTML web page
